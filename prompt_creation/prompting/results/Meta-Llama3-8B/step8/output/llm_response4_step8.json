    "data": "Based on the provided information, I will generate multiple technical architectures and use scenarios for the PREVENT-IA product. Then, I will review them and select the most consistent and robust architecture with comprehensive use scenarios.\n\n**Architecture 1:**\n\n* Frontend: React with Figma for UI/UX\n* Backend: AWS with Python and REST API\n* Database: pgVector for storing training data and user profiles\n* Cloud Computing: AWS for scalability and autoscaling\n* CI/CD: Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment\n* Secrets Management: AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage of sensitive data\n* AI/ML: GPT for generating content and evaluating learning outcomes\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n* Scenario 1: Onboarding new workers - The system generates a personalized training plan for new workers based on their job role and risk activities.\n* Scenario 2: Monitoring training progress - The system tracks the progress of workers who have started the training and provides feedback on their learning outcomes.\n* Scenario 3: Generating training content - The system uses GPT to generate training content on Occupational Risk Prevention (ORP) based on updated sources and verified information.\n\n**Architecture 2:**\n\n* Frontend: React with Figma for UI/UX\n* Backend: Jira with Python and REST API\n* Database: MySQL for storing training data and user profiles\n* Cloud Computing: Google Cloud for scalability and autoscaling\n* CI/CD: GitLab for continuous integration and deployment\n* Secrets Management: Google Cloud Secret Manager for secure storage of sensitive data\n* AI/ML: TensorFlow for generating content and evaluating learning outcomes\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n* Scenario 1: Onboarding new workers - The system generates a personalized training plan for new workers based on their job role and risk activities.\n* Scenario 2: Monitoring training progress - The system tracks the progress of workers who have started the training and provides feedback on their learning outcomes.\n* Scenario 3: Generating training content - The system uses TensorFlow to generate training content on Occupational Risk Prevention (ORP) based on updated sources and verified information.\n\n**Architecture 3:**\n\n* Frontend: Angular with Figma for UI/UX\n* Backend: AWS with Node.js and REST API\n* Database: MongoDB for storing training data and user profiles\n* Cloud Computing: Microsoft Azure for scalability and autoscaling\n* CI/CD: Azure DevOps for continuous integration and deployment\n* Secrets Management: Azure Key Vault for secure storage of sensitive data\n* AI/ML: Azure Machine Learning for generating content and evaluating learning outcomes\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n* Scenario 1: Onboarding new workers - The system generates a personalized training plan for new workers based on their job role and risk activities.\n* Scenario 2: Monitoring training progress - The system tracks the progress of workers who have started the training and provides feedback on their learning outcomes.\n* Scenario 3: Generating training content - The system uses Azure Machine Learning to generate training content on Occupational Risk Prevention (ORP) based on updated sources and verified information.\n\n**Review and Selection:**\n\nAfter reviewing the three architectures, I select Architecture 1 as the most consistent and robust architecture with comprehensive use scenarios. Here's why:\n\n* Architecture 1 uses a consistent technology stack (React, AWS, and pgVector) that is well-suited for building a scalable and secure AI-powered education platform.\n* The use scenarios are well-defined and cover the key objectives of PREVENT-IA, including onboarding new workers, monitoring training progress, and generating training content.\n* The architecture is well-architected, with clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and database layers.\n* The use of AWS and pgVector provides a scalable and secure foundation for the platform.\n* The use of GPT for generating content and evaluating learning outcomes provides a robust and accurate AI/ML capability.\n\nOverall, Architecture 1 provides a solid foundation for building a robust and scalable AI-powered education platform that meets the key objectives of PREVENT-IA.",
