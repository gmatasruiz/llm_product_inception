    "data": "Based on the provided information, I will generate multiple technical architectures and use scenarios for the PREVENT-IA product. I will then review and select the most consistent and robust architecture with comprehensive use scenarios.\n\n**Architecture 1:**\n\n* Frontend: React with Figma for UI/UX design\n* Backend: AWS with Python and REST API\n* Database: pgVector for storing training data and user profiles\n* Cloud Computing: AWS for scalability and autoscaling\n* CI/CD: Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment\n* Secrets Management: AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage of sensitive data\n* AI/ML: GPT for generating content and evaluating learning outcomes\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n* Scenario 1: User logs in to the platform and accesses the training content.\n* Scenario 2: User completes a training module and the platform evaluates their learning outcomes.\n* Scenario 3: The platform generates a report on the user's training progress.\n* Scenario 4: The platform updates the user's profile with their training completion status.\n\n**Architecture 2:**\n\n* Frontend: React with Figma for UI/UX design\n* Backend: AWS with Node.js and REST API\n* Database: MongoDB for storing training data and user profiles\n* Cloud Computing: Google Cloud for scalability and autoscaling\n* CI/CD: CircleCI for continuous integration and deployment\n* Secrets Management: Google Cloud Secret Manager for secure storage of sensitive data\n* AI/ML: TensorFlow for generating content and evaluating learning outcomes\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n* Scenario 1: User logs in to the platform and accesses the training content.\n* Scenario 2: User completes a training module and the platform evaluates their learning outcomes.\n* Scenario 3: The platform generates a report on the user's training progress.\n* Scenario 4: The platform updates the user's profile with their training completion status.\n\n**Architecture 3:**\n\n* Frontend: Angular with Figma for UI/UX design\n* Backend: Azure with.NET and REST API\n* Database: Azure Cosmos DB for storing training data and user profiles\n* Cloud Computing: Azure for scalability and autoscaling\n* CI/CD: Azure DevOps for continuous integration and deployment\n* Secrets Management: Azure Key Vault for secure storage of sensitive data\n* AI/ML: Azure Machine Learning for generating content and evaluating learning outcomes\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n* Scenario 1: User logs in to the platform and accesses the training content.\n* Scenario 2: User completes a training module and the platform evaluates their learning outcomes.\n* Scenario 3: The platform generates a report on the user's training progress.\n* Scenario 4: The platform updates the user's profile with their training completion status.\n\n**Review and Selection:**\n\nAfter reviewing the three architectures, I recommend selecting Architecture 1 as the most consistent and robust architecture with comprehensive use scenarios. Here's why:\n\n* AWS is a well-established cloud provider with a strong focus on security and scalability.\n* React is a popular frontend framework with a large community and extensive documentation.\n* pgVector is a reliable database solution for storing training data and user profiles.\n* GPT is a powerful AI/ML solution for generating content and evaluating learning outcomes.\n\nThe other architectures have some limitations. Architecture 2 uses Node.js, which may not be as scalable as Python. Architecture 3 uses.NET, which may not be as widely used as Python. Additionally, Azure may not be as cost-effective as AWS.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided information, I recommend selecting Architecture 1 as the most consistent and robust architecture with comprehensive use scenarios. This architecture uses AWS, React, pgVector, and GPT to provide a scalable and secure solution for the PREVENT-IA product.",
