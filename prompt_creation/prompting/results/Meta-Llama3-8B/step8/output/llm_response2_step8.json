    "data": "Based on the provided information, I propose a technical architecture for the PREVENT-IA AI-powered education platform. Here is a suggested architecture:\n\n**Architecture:**\n\n1. **Frontend:** React-based web application with Figma-designed UI/UX, using REST API to interact with the backend.\n2. **Backend:** Microservices-based architecture with the following components:\n\t* **Authentication Service:** Handles user authentication and authorization using AWS Cognito.\n\t* **Training Service:** Manages training content, user progress, and learning outcomes using a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and a caching layer (e.g., Redis).\n\t* **AI Service:** Utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., GPT) to generate content, evaluate learning outcomes, and provide personalized training recommendations.\n\t* **Storage Service:** Uses AWS S3 for storing training content, user data, and other files.\n\t* **API Gateway:** Securely exposes the backend services using AWS API Gateway.\n3. **Database:** PostgreSQL database for storing training content, user data, and other relevant information.\n4. **Cloud Services:** Utilizes AWS services such as:\n\t* **Cloud Computing:** For running the microservices and storing data.\n\t* **CI/CD:** For automating the build, test, and deployment process.\n\t* **Autoscaling Groups:** For scaling the microservices based on demand.\n\t* **Secrets Management:** For securely storing sensitive data such as API keys and passwords.\n\n**Use Scenarios:**\n\n1. **Stakeholder:** Developers\n**Use:** API integration\n**Risk:** Data breach\n\nExample: The developers need to integrate the PREVENT-IA platform with an existing HR system using the API. They need to ensure that the API is secure and that the data transmitted is encrypted to prevent a potential data breach.\n\n2. **Stakeholder:** Trainers\n**Use:** Content creation\n**Risk:** Inaccurate content\n\nExample: The trainers need to create training content for the PREVENT-IA platform. They need to ensure that the content is accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to the target audience to prevent the risk of inaccurate content.\n\n3. **Stakeholder:** Site Managers\n**Use:** Training tracking\n**Risk:** Lack of visibility\n\nExample: The site managers need to track the training progress of their workers using the PREVENT-IA platform. They need to ensure that they have visibility into the training status and can monitor the progress to prevent the risk of lack of visibility.\n\n4. **Stakeholder:** Workers\n**Use:** Personalized training\n**Risk:** Unfriendly interface\n\nExample: The workers need to access the PREVENT-IA platform for personalized training. They need to ensure that the interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate to prevent the risk of an unfriendly interface.\n\nThis architecture and use scenarios provide a solid foundation for the PREVENT-IA AI-powered education platform, ensuring that it is secure, scalable, and user-friendly.",
