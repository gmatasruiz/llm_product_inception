    "data": "Based on the provided information, I propose a technical architecture for the PREVENT-IA AI-powered education platform. Here is a suggested architecture and use scenarios:\n\n**Technical Architecture:**\n\n1. **Frontend:** React-based web application with Figma-designed UI/UX, using REST API to interact with the backend.\n2. **Backend:** Microservices-based architecture with Python as the primary language, using AWS as the cloud provider. The services will be:\n\t* **Training Service:** Responsible for generating and managing training content, using PDF Editor to create interactive content.\n\t* **Learning Service:** Handles user interactions, evaluates learning outcomes, and generates reports.\n\t* **Content Service:** Manages and updates content from verified sources, using pgVector for natural language processing.\n\t* **User Service:** Manages user profiles, assigns training, and tracks progress.\n3. **Database:** Cloud-based storage using AWS, with Secrets Management for secure storage of sensitive data.\n4. **API Gateway:** Secure API gateway using AWS, to manage API requests and access control.\n5. **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline using Code Builder and Jira, to automate testing, building, and deployment of the application.\n6. **Scalability:** Autoscaling Groups and Cloud Computing to ensure scalability and high availability.\n7. **GPT:** Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) for natural language processing and content generation.\n\n**Use Scenarios:**\n\n1. **Stakeholder:** Developers\n**Use:** API integration\n**Risk:** Data breach\n**Description:** Developers will integrate the PREVENT-IA API with their existing systems to access training content and user data, while ensuring secure data transmission and storage.\n\n2. **Stakeholder:** Trainers\n**Use:** Content creation\n**Risk:** Inaccurate content\n**Description:** Trainers will create and update training content using the PDF Editor, ensuring that the content is accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to the target audience.\n\n3. **Stakeholder:** Site Managers\n**Use:** Training tracking\n**Risk:** Lack of visibility on training progress\n**Description:** Site Managers will track the training progress of their workers, ensuring that they are aware of their employees' training status and can identify areas for improvement.\n\n4. **Stakeholder:** Workers\n**Use:** Interactive learning\n**Risk:** Unfriendly interface\n**Description:** Workers will access the PREVENT-IA platform to complete interactive training modules, ensuring that they have a user-friendly and engaging learning experience.\n\n5. **Stakeholder:** Managers\n**Use:** Learning results dashboard\n**Risk:** Difficulty in measuring training quality\n**Description:** Managers will access the learning results dashboard to monitor the training progress of their team members, ensuring that they can identify areas for improvement and measure the effectiveness of the training program.\n\nThis technical architecture and use scenarios provide a solid foundation for the PREVENT-IA AI-powered education platform, ensuring that it is scalable, secure, and user-friendly.",
