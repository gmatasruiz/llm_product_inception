    "data": "**Technical Architecture Proposal**\n\nThe proposed technical architecture for the product is a cloud-based, microservices-based architecture that is scalable, secure, and highly available. The architecture is designed to support the product's core features, including image support, and to provide a flexible and extensible foundation for future development.\n\n**Components**\n\n1. **Frontend**: The frontend is built using a modern web framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js) and is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input.\n2. **API Gateway**: The API Gateway is responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate microservices and providing a single entry point for the frontend to interact with the backend.\n3. **Image Processing Service**: This microservice is responsible for processing and manipulating images, including resizing, cropping, and applying filters.\n4. **Database**: The database is responsible for storing and retrieving data, including user profiles, product information, and image metadata.\n5. **Search Service**: This microservice is responsible for indexing and searching product information and images.\n6. **Payment Gateway**: The payment gateway is responsible for processing payment transactions and integrating with the product's payment processing system.\n7. **Security**: The security component is responsible for authenticating and authorizing users, as well as protecting the product from unauthorized access and malicious activity.\n\n**Architecture Diagram**\n\nHere is a diagram

three use scenarios for the product:\n\n**Use Scenario 1: User Profile**\n\n* **Stakeholder**: User\n* **Common Use**: User creates a profile, uploads a profile picture, and adds a bio.\n* **Risks**: User may upload an invalid or malicious image, or may enter incorrect information in their profile.\n* **Technical Requirements**: The product must validate and sanitize user input, and must have a secure image processing pipeline to prevent unauthorized access to user data.\n\n**Use Scenario 2: Product Search**\n\n* **Stakeholder**: Customer\n* **Common Use**: Customer searches for products by keyword, category, or brand, and views search results with images and product information.\n* **Risks**: Search results may be slow or inaccurate, or may return irrelevant results.\n* **Technical Requirements**: The product must have a scalable search infrastructure (e.g., Elasticsearch) and must implement efficient search algorithms to ensure fast and accurate search results.\n\n**Use Scenario 3: Payment Processing**\n\n* **Stakeholder**: Customer\n* **Common Use**: Customer purchases a product and enters payment information, and the product processes the payment transaction.\n* **Risks**: Payment information may be compromised, or the payment processing system may fail.\n* **Technical Requirements**: The product must have a secure payment processing system (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) and must implement robust security measures to protect payment information.\n\nThese use scenarios highlight the key technical requirements and risks associated with each use case, and provide a foundation for designing and implementing the product's technical architecture.",
