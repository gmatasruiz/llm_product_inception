    "data": "Based on the provided information, I will propose a technical architecture for the PREVENT-IA product and provide use scenarios.\n\n**Technical Architecture:**\n\nThe proposed technical architecture for PREVENT-IA is a cloud-based, microservices-based architecture that leverages the scalability and reliability of cloud computing. The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for easy maintenance, updates, and scalability.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Frontend:** A React-based web application that provides the user interface for the PREVENT-IA platform. The frontend will be responsible for handling user interactions, rendering the UI, and sending requests to the backend services.\n2. **Backend:** A set of microservices built using Python and RESTful APIs that provide the business logic and data processing capabilities for the PREVENT-IA platform. The backend services will be responsible for handling requests from the frontend, processing data, and interacting with the database.\n3. **Database:** A PostgreSQL database that stores the training content, user data, and learning outcomes. The database will be designed to support the scalability and performance requirements of the PREVENT-IA platform.\n4. **AI Model:** A machine learning model that provides the AI-powered education capabilities for the PREVENT-IA platform. The AI model will be responsible for generating personalized learning content, evaluating learning outcomes, and providing feedback to users.\n5. **CI/CD:** A continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment of the PREVENT-IA platform. The CI/CD pipeline will ensure that the platform is always up-to-date and secure.\n6. **Cloud Services:** A set of cloud services that provide the infrastructure and platform for the PREVENT-IA platform. The cloud services will include AWS services such as autoscaling groups, secrets management, and code builder.\n\n**Use Scenarios:**\n\n**Scenario 1:** A worker at a construction site logs into the PREVENT-IA platform and begins a training session on Occupational Risk Prevention (ORP). The platform uses AI-powered education capabilities to generate personalized learning content and evaluate the worker's learning outcomes.\n\n**Scenario 2:** A site manager wants to track the training progress of their workers and access the learning outcomes. The PREVENT-IA platform provides a dashboard that allows the site manager to view the training progress and learning outcomes of their workers.\n\n**Scenario 3:** A company wants to provide on-site training to their workers on Occupational Risk Prevention (ORP). The PREVENT-IA platform provides a mobile app that allows workers to access the training content and complete the training sessions on-site.\n\n**Scenario 4:** A trainer wants to create a new training content on Occupational Risk Prevention (ORP). The PREVENT-IA platform provides a content creation tool that allows the trainer to create and upload new content to the platform.\n\n**Scenario 5:** A company wants to evaluate the effectiveness of the PREVENT-IA platform in reducing workplace accidents. The platform provides a reporting feature that allows the company to track the number of accidents and evaluate the effectiveness of the training program.\n\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n\nThe proposed technical architecture for PREVENT-IA has several strengths, including:\n\n* Scalability: The cloud-based architecture and microservices design allow for easy scalability and flexibility.\n* Reliability: The use of cloud services and automated deployment pipeline ensures that the platform is always up-to-date and secure.\n* Flexibility: The modular design allows for easy maintenance and updates.\n\nHowever, the architecture also has some weaknesses, including:\n\n* Complexity: The use of microservices and cloud services can add complexity to the architecture and make it more difficult to manage.\n* Security: The use of cloud services and automated deployment pipeline requires careful consideration of security and compliance requirements.\n\nOverall, the proposed technical architecture for PREVENT-IA provides a scalable, reliable, and flexible solution for the company's needs. However, it is important to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of the architecture and to ensure that it meets the company's security and compliance requirements.",
