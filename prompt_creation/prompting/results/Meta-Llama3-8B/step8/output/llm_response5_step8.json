    "data": "Based on the provided information, I will propose a technical architecture for the PREVENT-IA product and provide use scenarios.\n\n**Technical Architecture:**\n\nThe proposed technical architecture for PREVENT-IA is a cloud-based, microservices-based architecture that leverages the scalability and reliability of cloud computing. The architecture is designed to be highly available, secure, and scalable to support a large number of users and a large volume of data.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Frontend:** The frontend will be built using React and will be responsible for handling user interactions, rendering the user interface, and sending requests to the backend.\n2. **Backend:** The backend will be built using Python and will be responsible for handling requests from the frontend, interacting with the database, and performing business logic.\n3. **Database:** The database will be a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) that will store all the data related to the users, courses, and training activities.\n4. **API Gateway:** The API Gateway will be responsible for handling incoming requests, authenticating and authorizing users, and routing requests to the appropriate microservices.\n5. **Microservices:**\n\t* **Content Service:** This microservice will be responsible for generating content, updating sources, and evaluating learning outcomes.\n\t* **Training Service:** This microservice will be responsible for assigning training to workers, tracking training activities, and generating reports.\n\t* **User Service:** This microservice will be responsible for managing user profiles, assigning roles, and handling user authentication and authorization.\n6. **Message Queue:** The message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) will be used to handle asynchronous processing of tasks, such as sending notifications and generating reports.\n7. **Storage:** The storage component will be responsible for storing and retrieving files, such as PDFs and images.\n\n**Use Scenarios:**\n\n**Scenario 1:** A worker logs in to the PREVENT-IA platform and is assigned a training activity related to Occupational Risk Prevention (ORP).\n\n* The worker's user profile is retrieved from the User Service microservice.\n* The training activity is retrieved from the Training Service microservice.\n* The worker is presented with a personalized learning experience, including interactive content and quizzes.\n* The worker's progress is tracked and stored in the database.\n\n**Scenario 2:** A manager wants to track the training activities of their team members.\n\n* The manager logs in to the PREVENT-IA platform and accesses the Training Service microservice.\n* The manager can view the training activities assigned to their team members and track their progress.\n* The manager can generate reports on the training activities and track the learning outcomes.\n\n**Scenario 3:** A trainer wants to create a new training activity.\n\n* The trainer logs in to the PREVENT-IA platform and accesses the Content Service microservice.\n* The trainer can create a new training activity, including interactive content and quizzes.\n* The trainer can assign the training activity to workers and track their progress.\n\n**Security and Scalability:**\n\n* The architecture will be designed to be highly available, with multiple instances of each microservice and database.\n* The architecture will be scalable, with the ability to add or remove instances of each microservice and database as needed.\n* The architecture will be secure, with encryption and authentication mechanisms in place to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe proposed technical architecture for PREVENT-IA is a cloud-based, microservices-based architecture that leverages the scalability and reliability of cloud computing. The architecture is designed to be highly available, secure, and scalable to support a large number of users and a large volume of data. The use scenarios demonstrate how the architecture can be used to support the key objectives of PREVENT-IA, including reducing the number of workplace accidents, facilitating access to on-site ORP training, and ensuring the monitoring of ORP training.",
