    "data": "Based on the provided information, I propose a technical architecture for the PREVENT-IA product. The architecture is designed to meet the key objectives of reducing workplace accidents, facilitating access to on-site ORP training, and ensuring the monitoring of ORP training.\n\n**Technical Architecture:**\n\nThe proposed architecture consists of the following components:\n\n1. **Frontend:**\n\t* Web Platform (React): Responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.\n\t* UI/UX (Figma): Used to design the user interface and user experience.\n2. **Backend:**\n\t* REST API (Python): Handles requests from the frontend, interacts with the database, and performs business logic.\n\t* AWS (Cloud Computing): Provides scalability, reliability, and security for the application.\n\t* pgVector (Database): Stores training content, user data, and learning outcomes.\n3. **AI/ML Components:**\n\t* GPT (Natural Language Processing): Used to generate content from updated sources and evaluate learning outcomes.\n\t* AI Model Providers (e.g., Google Cloud AI): Provides AI-powered features such as chat for resolving doubts and personalized training.\n4. **Integration Components:**\n\t* Jira (Issue Tracking): Used to manage training content and track learning outcomes.\n\t* Email (Communication): Used to send notifications and reminders to users.\n\t* GitHub (Version Control): Used to manage code and collaborate with developers.\n5. **Security and Monitoring:**\n\t* Secrets Management (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager): Used to store and manage sensitive data such as API keys and passwords.\n\t* CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment): Used to automate testing, building, and deployment of the application.\n\t* Autoscaling Groups (AWS): Used to scale the application based on demand.\n\n**Architecture Diagram:**\n\nHere is a high-level diagram of the proposed architecture:\n```\n                                      +---------------+\n                                      |  Web Platform  |\n
