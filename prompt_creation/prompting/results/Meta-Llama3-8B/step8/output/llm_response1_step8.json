    "data": "Based on the provided information, I propose a technical architecture for the PREVENT-IA product. The architecture is designed to support the key objectives of the product, which are to reduce the number of workplace accidents, facilitate access to on-site ORP training, and ensure the monitoring of ORP training.\n\n**Technical Architecture:**\n\nThe proposed architecture consists of the following components:\n\n1. **Frontend:** The frontend is built using React and is responsible for handling user interactions, rendering the user interface, and sending requests to the backend.\n2. **Backend:** The backend is built using Python and is responsible for processing requests from the frontend, interacting with the database, and generating reports.\n3. **Database:** The database is built using PostgreSQL and is responsible for storing user data, training content, and learning outcomes.\n4. **AI Model:** The AI model is used to generate content, evaluate learning outcomes, and provide personalized training recommendations.\n5. **Cloud Infrastructure:** The cloud infrastructure is built using AWS and is responsible for hosting the application, providing scalability, and managing resources.\n6. **CI/CD:** The CI/CD pipeline is used to automate the build, test, and deployment process of the application.\n7. **Secrets Management:** Secrets management is used to store and manage sensitive data such as API keys and database credentials.\n\n**Architecture Diagram:**\n\nHere is a diagram of the proposed architecture:\n```\n                                      +---------------+\n                                      |  Frontend  |\n                                      +---------------+\n                                             |\n                                             |  React\n                                             |\n                                             v\n                                      +---------------+\n                                      |  Backend  |\n                                      +---------------+\n                                             |\n                                             |  Python\n                                             |\n                                             v\n                                      +---------------+\n                                      |  Database  |\n                                      +---------------+\n                                             |\n                                             |  PostgreSQL\n                                             |\n                                             v\n                                      +---------------+\n                                      |  AI Model  |\n                                      +---------------+\n                                             |\n                                             |  GPT\n                                             |\n                                             v\n                                      +---------------+\n                                      |  Cloud Infrastructure  |\n                                      +---------------+\n                                             |\n                                             |  AWS\n                                             |\n                                             v\n                                      +---------------+\n                                      |  CI/CD  |\n                                      +---------------+\n                                             |\n                                             |  Jenkins\n                                             |\n                                             v\n                                      +---------------+\n                                      |  Secrets Management  |\n                                      +---------------+\n                                             |\n                                             |  HashiCorp\n                                             |\n                                             v\n```\n**Use Scenarios:**\n\nHere are some use scenarios for the PREVENT-IA product:\n\n**Use Scenario 1:** A worker is assigned to a high-risk activity and needs to complete an ORP training course. The worker logs in to the PREVENT-IA platform, accesses the training course, and completes the course. The AI model evaluates the worker's learning outcomes and provides a report to the site manager.\n\n**Stakeholder:** Worker\n**Common Use:** Completing ORP training course\n**Risks:** Negative public opinion on the use of AI, dependence on AI model providers\n\n**Use Scenario 2:** A site manager needs to track the training progress of workers assigned to high-risk activities. The site manager logs in to the PREVENT-IA platform, views the training progress of the workers, and generates a report.\n\n**Stakeholder:** Site Manager\n**Common Use:** Tracking training progress of workers\n**Risks:** Difficulty in measuring training quality, low visibility on social media\n\n**Use Scenario 3:** A trainer needs to create a new ORP training course. The trainer logs in to the PREVENT-IA platform, creates a new course, and uploads content.\n\n**Stakeholder:** Trainer\n**Common Use:** Creating a new ORP training course\n**Risks:** Poor prioritization of functionalities, lack of feedback\n\n**Use Scenario 4:** A manager needs to access the learning results dashboard to monitor the training progress of workers. The manager logs in to the PREVENT-IA platform, views the learning results dashboard, and generates a report.\n\n**Stakeholder:** Manager\n**Common Use:** Accessing the learning results dashboard\n**Risks:** Difficulty in measuring training quality, low visibility on social media\n\nI hope this proposed architecture and use scenarios meet your requirements.",
