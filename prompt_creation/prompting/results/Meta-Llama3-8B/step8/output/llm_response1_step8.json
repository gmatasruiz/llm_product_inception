    "data": "**Technical Architecture Proposal**\n\nThe proposed technical architecture for the product is a cloud-based, microservices-based architecture that is scalable, secure, and highly available. The architecture is designed to support the product's features, including image support, and to provide a robust and reliable platform for the product.\n\n**Components**\n\n1. **Frontend**: The frontend is built using a web framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) and is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input.\n2. **API Gateway**: The API Gateway is responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate microservices and providing a single entry point for the frontend to interact with the backend.\n3. **Image Processing Service**: The Image Processing Service is responsible for processing and manipulating images, including resizing, cropping, and applying filters.\n4. **Model Service**: The Model Service is responsible for storing and retrieving models, including machine learning models and other types of models.\n5. **Database**: The Database is responsible for storing and retrieving data, including images, models, and other metadata.\n6. **Message Queue**: The Message Queue is responsible for handling asynchronous communication between microservices and providing a mechanism for handling tasks that require processing outside of the request-response cycle.\n\n**Architecture Diagram**\n\nHere is a diagram of the proposed architecture:\n```\n                                      +---------------+\n
