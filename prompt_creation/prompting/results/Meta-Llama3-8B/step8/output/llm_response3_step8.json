    "data": "Based on the provided information, I propose the following architecture for the PREVENT-IA product:\n\n**Architecture Components:**\n\n1. **Frontend:** React-based web application with UI/UX designed for easy navigation and interaction.\n2. **Backend:** Python-based REST API with AWS as the cloud infrastructure provider.\n3. **Database:** pgVector-based database for storing user data, training content, and learning outcomes.\n4. **AI Model:** GPT-based AI model for generating content, evaluating learning outcomes, and providing personalized training recommendations.\n5. **Integration:** Jira for issue tracking, Email for notifications, and GitHub for version control.\n6. **Security:** Secrets Management for secure storage of sensitive data, and CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.\n7. **Scalability:** Autoscaling Groups for automatic scaling of resources based on demand.\n\n**Use Scenarios:**\n\n**Scenario 1: User Registration and Profile Management**\n\n1. A worker registers on the PREVENT-IA platform using their company email and password.\n2. The system creates a user profile and assigns the worker to a specific site or activity.\n3. The worker's profile is updated with their job title, department, and other relevant information.\n\n**Scenario 2: Access to On-Site ORP Training**\n\n1. A site manager logs in to the PREVENT-IA platform and requests access to on-site ORP training for their workers.\n2. The system generates a unique training link and sends it to the site manager via email.\n3. The site manager shares the link with the workers, who can access the training content and start the training process.\n\n**Scenario 3: Training and Evaluation**\n\n1. A worker accesses the training link and starts the training process.\n2. The system presents interactive content, including videos, images, and text, with AI-powered evaluation and feedback mechanisms.\n3. The worker completes the training and receives a report on their learning outcomes, which is stored in their user profile.\n\n**Scenario 4: Reporting and Analytics**\n\n1. A manager logs in to the PREVENT-IA platform and requests a report on the training outcomes for their team.\n2. The system generates a report with detailed information on the training outcomes, including completion rates, learning outcomes, and feedback.\n3. The manager can use this report to identify areas for improvement and track the effectiveness of the training program.\n\n**Scenario 5: Content Management and Updates**\n\n1. A trainer logs in to the PREVENT-IA platform and updates the training content with new information and resources.\n2. The system generates a new version of the training content and updates the database with the latest information.\n3. The AI model is re-trained with the updated content to ensure that the training recommendations are accurate and relevant.\n\n**Risks and Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n1. **Negative public opinion on the use of AI:** Mitigation strategy: Provide transparency on the use of AI and its benefits in improving training outcomes and reducing accidents.\n2. **Energy consumption:** Mitigation strategy: Optimize the cloud infrastructure and use energy-efficient technologies to minimize energy consumption.\n3. **Dependence on AI model providers:** Mitigation strategy: Develop a diversified AI model ecosystem and ensure that the platform is not overly dependent on a single AI model provider.\n4. **Unfriendly interfaces:** Mitigation strategy: Conduct user testing and gather feedback to improve the user experience and ensure that the interfaces are user-friendly and intuitive.\n\nBy following this architecture and use scenarios, PREVENT-IA can provide a comprehensive and effective solution for educating workers on Occupational Risk Prevention, while minimizing risks and ensuring scalability and security.",
