    "data": "Based on the provided information, I will propose an architecture for the PREVENT-IA product and provide use scenarios step by step.\n\n**Architecture Proposal:**\n\nThe proposed architecture for PREVENT-IA is a cloud-based, scalable, and secure platform that utilizes a combination of technologies to deliver an AI-powered education platform for Occupational Risk Prevention (ORP) training.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Frontend:** A user-friendly interface built using React and Figma, providing a seamless learning experience for users.\n2. **Backend:** A RESTful API built using Python, handling user requests, data storage, and communication with the AI model.\n3. **AI Model:** A machine learning model trained on a large dataset of ORP-related content, providing personalized learning recommendations and evaluating learning outcomes.\n4. **Database:** A cloud-based database (e.g., AWS RDS) storing user data, learning outcomes, and AI model outputs.\n5. **Cloud Services:** AWS services such as Autoscaling Groups, Code Builder, and Secrets Management ensuring scalability, security, and reliability.\n6. **PDF Editor:** A third-party PDF editor (e.g., PDF Editor) for generating and editing training materials.\n7. **Jira:** A project management tool for tracking and managing training content, user progress, and certification.\n8. **Email:** A notification system for sending reminders, updates, and certification notifications to users.\n9. **CI/CD:** A continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for automating testing, building, and deployment of the platform.\n\n**Use Scenarios:**\n\n**Scenario 1: User Registration and Profile Creation**\n\n1. A worker registers on the PREVENT-IA platform using their company email and password.\n2. The platform creates a user profile, assigning the user to a specific role (e.g., worker, manager, or trainer).\n3. The user is redirected to the platform's dashboard, where they can access available training courses and their learning history.\n\n**Scenario 2: Accessing and Completing Training Courses**\n\n1. A worker logs in to the platform and accesses the training course catalog.\n2. The worker selects a course and begins the training, interacting with the AI-powered learning content.\n3. The AI model evaluates the worker's learning outcomes and provides personalized feedback and recommendations.\n4. The worker completes the training course and receives a certification notification via email.\n\n**Scenario 3: Tracking and Monitoring Training Progress**\n\n1. A site manager logs in to the platform and accesses the training tracking feature.\n2. The site manager views the training progress of their team members, including completed courses and certification status.\n3. The site manager can also generate reports on training completion rates and certification levels.\n\n**Scenario 4: AI-Powered Learning Recommendations**\n\n1. A worker completes a training course and receives personalized learning recommendations from the AI model.\n2. The AI model analyzes the worker's learning outcomes and suggests additional training courses based on their interests and learning style.\n3. The worker can access the recommended courses and begin the training process.\n\n**Risks and Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n1. **Negative public opinion on the use of AI:** Mitigation strategy: Provide transparency on the use of AI in the platform and highlight its benefits in improving learning outcomes and reducing workplace accidents.\n2. **Energy consumption:** Mitigation strategy: Optimize the platform's architecture for scalability and efficiency, using cloud services that provide cost-effective and environmentally friendly solutions.\n3. **Dependence on AI model providers:** Mitigation strategy: Develop a diverse AI model that can be easily updated and maintained, reducing dependence on a single provider.\n\nBy following this architecture and use scenario, PREVENT-IA can provide a comprehensive and effective AI-powered education platform for Occupational Risk Prevention (ORP) training, reducing the number of workplace accidents and improving the safety of workers.",
