    "data": "Based on the provided information, I have identified four stakeholder groups and created tables to represent their involvement in the PREVENT-IA project.\n\n**Stakeholder Groups:**\n\n1. **Core Team**: These stakeholders are responsible for the development and maintenance of PREVENT-IA. They have a deep understanding of the project and are involved in its daily operations.\n2. **Frequent Involvement Stakeholders**: These stakeholders are regularly involved in the project and have a significant interest in its success. They may be responsible for specific tasks or have a vested interest in the project's outcomes.\n3. **Occasional Involvement Stakeholders**: These stakeholders are occasionally involved in the project and may have a limited interest in its success. They may be consulted on specific issues or have a peripheral role in the project.\n4. **Seldom Involvement Stakeholders**: These stakeholders are rarely involved in the project and may have a limited interest in its success. They may be informed about the project's progress or have a general interest in its outcomes.\n\n**Tables of Stakeholder Involvement:**\n\n**Core Team**\n\n| Stakeholder | Involvement Level | Frequency of Involvement |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Project Manager | High | Daily |\n| Software Developers | High | Daily |\n| AI Model Developers | High | Daily |\n| UX/UI Designers | High | Daily |\n| Quality Assurance Engineers | High | Daily |\n\n**Frequent Involvement Stakeholders**\n\n| Stakeholder | Involvement Level | Frequency of Involvement |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Business Analysts | Medium | Weekly |\n| Training Managers | Medium | Weekly |\n| Safety Experts | Medium | Bi-Weekly |\n| IT Department | Medium | Bi-Weekly |\n\n**Occasional Involvement Stakeholders**\n\n| Stakeholder | Involvement Level | Frequency of Involvement |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| HR Department | Low | Monthly |\n| Compliance Officers | Low | Quarterly |\n| IT Security Experts | Low | Quarterly |\n\n**Seldom Involvement Stakeholders**\n\n| Stakeholder | Involvement Level | Frequency of Involvement |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| External Auditors | Low | Annually |\n| Regulatory Bodies | Low | Annually |\n| Investors | Low | Quarterly |\n\nAfter reviewing the tables, I selected the most consistent and accurate representation as follows:\n\n* The Core Team is responsible for the daily operations and development of PREVENT-IA, and their involvement level is high.\n* The Frequent Involvement Stakeholders have a medium to high level of involvement and are regularly involved in the project, with a focus on specific tasks or areas of expertise.\n* The Occasional Involvement Stakeholders have a low to medium level of involvement and are occasionally involved in the project, with a focus on specific issues or areas of expertise.\n* The Seldom Involvement Stakeholders have a low level of involvement and are rarely involved in the project, with a focus on general information or oversight.\n\nThis representation is consistent and accurate because it reflects the different levels of involvement and expertise required for each stakeholder group. The Core Team is responsible for the day-to-day operations, while the Frequent Involvement Stakeholders have a deeper understanding of the project and are regularly involved. The Occasional Involvement Stakeholders have a more peripheral role, while the Seldom Involvement Stakeholders have a limited interest in the project's outcomes.",
