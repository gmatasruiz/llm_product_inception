    "data": "Based on the provided information, I have identified four stakeholder groups and created tables to represent their involvement in the PREVENT-IA project.\n\n**Stakeholder Groups:**\n\n1. **Core Team**: These stakeholders are responsible for the development and maintenance of PREVENT-IA. They have a deep understanding of the project and are involved in its daily operations.\n2. **Frequent Involvement Stakeholders**: These stakeholders are regularly involved in the project and have a significant impact on its development. They may be responsible for specific tasks or areas of the project.\n3. **Occasional Involvement Stakeholders**: These stakeholders are occasionally involved in the project and may provide input or guidance on specific aspects of the project.\n4. **Seldom Involvement Stakeholders**: These stakeholders are rarely involved in the project and may only be consulted on specific issues or decisions.\n\n**Tables of Stakeholder Involvement:**\n\n**Core Team**\n\n| Stakeholder | Involvement Level | Responsibilities |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Project Manager | High | Overall project management, decision-making |\n| Software Developers | High | Development, maintenance, and testing of the platform |\n| AI/ML Experts | High | Development and maintenance of AI-powered features |\n| UX/UI Designers | High | Design and development of user interface and user experience |\n\n**Frequent Involvement Stakeholders**\n\n| Stakeholder | Involvement Level | Responsibilities |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Training Specialists | Medium | Development of training content, evaluation of learning outcomes |\n| Occupational Health and Safety Experts | Medium | Review of ORP training content, provision of expertise on risk prevention |\n| IT Professionals | Medium | Maintenance and support of the platform's infrastructure |\n| Business Analysts | Medium | Analysis of business needs and requirements |\n\n**Occasional Involvement Stakeholders**\n\n| Stakeholder | Involvement Level | Responsibilities |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Subject Matter Experts | Low | Provision of expertise on specific topics or activities |\n| Quality Assurance Specialists | Low | Review of training content and platform functionality |\n| Marketing and Sales Professionals | Low | Promotion and sales of the platform |\n\n**Seldom Involvement Stakeholders**\n\n| Stakeholder | Involvement Level | Responsibilities |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Compliance Officers | Low | Review of platform compliance with regulations and standards |\n| Auditors | Low | Review of platform functionality and compliance |\n| Investors | Low | Review of project progress and financial performance |\n\nAfter reviewing the tables, I selected the most consistent and accurate representation of stakeholder involvement. The Core Team has the highest level of involvement, as they are responsible for the development and maintenance of the platform. The Frequent Involvement Stakeholders have a medium level of involvement, as they are regularly involved in specific aspects of the project. The Occasional Involvement Stakeholders have a low level of involvement, as they are occasionally consulted on specific issues or decisions. The Seldom Involvement Stakeholders have a very low level of involvement, as they are rarely involved in the project and may only be consulted on specific issues or decisions.",
