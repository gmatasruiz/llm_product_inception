    "data": "Based on the provided information, I have reflected on previous projects and their stakeholder involvement. I have considered their roles and implications and created four stakeholder groups for the PREVENT-IA product.\n\n**Stakeholder Groups:**\n\n1. **Core Team**: These stakeholders are essential to the development and success of PREVENT-IA. They will be heavily involved throughout the project and will have a significant impact on the product's direction and outcome.\n\t* Roles: Project Manager, AI/ML Engineer, Education Specialist, UX/UI Designer, Business Development Manager\n2. **Frequent Involvement Stakeholders**: These stakeholders will be involved regularly throughout the project, providing input and feedback on specific aspects of the product.\n\t* Roles: Training Managers, Safety Officers, IT Department, Compliance Officers, HR Department\n3. **Occasional Involvement Stakeholders**: These stakeholders will be involved periodically, providing input on specific aspects of the product or providing feedback on specific features.\n\t* Roles: Subject Matter Experts (e.g., occupational risk prevention experts), Quality Assurance Team, Marketing Department, Sales Team\n4. **Seldom Involvement Stakeholders**: These stakeholders will be involved only occasionally, providing input on high-level aspects of the product or providing feedback on overall direction.\n\t* Roles: Executive Management, Board Members, Investors, Regulatory Bodies\n\n**Stakeholder Table:**\n\n| Stakeholder Group | Stakeholder Roles | Involvement Level | Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Core Team | Project Manager, AI/ML Engineer, Education Specialist, UX/UI Designer, Business Development Manager | High | Essential to the project's success, will have significant impact on the product's direction and outcome |\n| Frequent Involvement Stakeholders | Training Managers, Safety Officers, IT Department, Compliance Officers, HR Department | Medium-High | Will provide input and feedback on specific aspects of the product, will have significant impact on the product's implementation |\n| Occasional Involvement Stakeholders | Subject Matter Experts, Quality Assurance Team, Marketing Department, Sales Team | Medium | Will provide input on specific aspects of the product or provide feedback on specific features, will have moderate impact on the product's implementation |\n| Seldom Involvement Stakeholders | Executive Management, Board Members, Investors, Regulatory Bodies | Low | Will provide input on high-level aspects of the product or provide feedback on overall direction, will have limited impact on the product's implementation |\n\nNote: The involvement level is subjective and based on the assumption that the stakeholders will be involved in the project to varying degrees. The implications column highlights the potential impact of each stakeholder group on the project's success.",
