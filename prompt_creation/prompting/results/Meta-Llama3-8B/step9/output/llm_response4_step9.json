    "data": "Here are four tables of risks and their classifications, along with mitigation plans:\n\n**Table 1: Risk Classification and Mitigation Plans**\n\n| Risk | Classification | Mitigation Plan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cyber Attack | High | Implement a robust cybersecurity system, conduct regular security audits, and train employees on cybersecurity best practices. |\n| Data Breach | High | Implement encryption, conduct regular backups, and limit access to sensitive data. |\n| Natural Disaster | Medium | Develop a business continuity plan, conduct regular drills, and have a disaster recovery plan in place. |\n| Employee Error | Medium | Implement a quality control process, conduct regular training, and monitor employee performance. |\n| Supplier Failure | Medium | Conduct regular supplier audits, implement a supplier management process, and have a contingency plan in place. |\n| Financial Loss | Low | Implement a financial management system, conduct regular financial reviews, and have a contingency plan in place. |\n| Reputation Damage | Low | Implement a reputation management system, conduct regular social media monitoring, and have a crisis communication plan in place. |\n| Compliance Failure | Discarded | Not applicable |\n\n**Table 2: Risk Classification and Mitigation Plans**\n\n| Risk | Classification | Mitigation Plan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Business Interruption | High | Develop a business continuity plan, conduct regular drills, and have a disaster recovery plan in place. |\n| Information Security Breach | High | Implement a robust cybersecurity system, conduct regular security audits, and train employees on cybersecurity best practices. |\n| Operational Risk | Medium | Implement a risk management process, conduct regular risk assessments, and have a contingency plan in place. |\n| Supply Chain Disruption | Medium | Conduct regular supplier audits, implement a supplier management process, and have a contingency plan in place. |\n| Employee Theft | Low | Implement a security system, conduct regular audits, and monitor employee behavior. |\n| Environmental Risk | Low | Implement an environmental management system, conduct regular environmental assessments, and have a contingency plan in place. |\n| Regulatory Non-Compliance | Discarded | Not applicable |\n\n**Table 3: Risk Classification and Mitigation Plans**\n\n| Risk | Classification | Mitigation Plan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| IT System Failure | High | Implement a robust IT system, conduct regular IT audits, and train employees on IT best practices. |\n| Human Error | Medium | Implement a quality control process, conduct regular training, and monitor employee performance. |\n| Market Risk | Medium | Implement a risk management process, conduct regular risk assessments, and have a contingency plan in place. |\n| Reputation Risk | Low | Implement a reputation management system, conduct regular social media monitoring, and have a crisis communication plan in place. |\n| Compliance Risk | Low | Implement a compliance management system, conduct regular compliance reviews, and have a contingency plan in place. |\n| Business Continuity Risk | Discarded | Not applicable |\n\n**Table 4: Risk Classification and Mitigation Plans**\n\n| Risk | Classification | Mitigation Plan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Risk Management Failure | High | Implement a risk management process, conduct regular risk assessments, and have a contingency plan in place. |\n| Compliance Failure | High | Implement a compliance management system, conduct regular compliance reviews, and have a contingency plan in place. |\n| IT Security Risk | Medium | Implement a robust IT security system, conduct regular IT security audits, and train employees on IT security best practices. |\n| Employee Risk | Medium | Implement a quality control process, conduct regular training, and monitor employee performance. |\n| Financial Risk | Low | Implement a financial management system, conduct regular financial reviews, and have a contingency plan in place. |\n| Reputation Risk | Discarded | Not applicable |\n\nAfter reviewing these tables, I selected Table 1 as the most consistent and comprehensive table with effective mitigation plans. Here's why:\n\n* The risks are categorized into High, Medium, Low, and Discarded, which provides a clear and consistent framework for risk classification.\n* The mitigation plans are specific, actionable, and relevant to each risk, which provides a clear and effective plan for mitigating each risk.\n* The table covers a range of risks, including cyber attacks, data breaches, natural disasters, employee errors, supplier failures, and financial losses, which provides a comprehensive view of potential risks.\n* The table does not include any redundant or duplicate risks, which ensures that the table is concise and easy to use.\n\nOverall, Table 1 provides a clear and effective framework for identifying and mitigating potential risks, and is therefore the most consistent and comprehensive table with effective mitigation plans.",
