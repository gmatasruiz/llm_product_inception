    "data": "Here is the table of possible risks and their classification:\n\n| Risk | Classification | Mitigation Plan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Negative public opinion on the use of AI | High | Conduct thorough market research to understand public perception of AI-based training platforms. Develop a communication strategy to address concerns and promote the benefits of PREVENT-IA. |\n| Energy consumption | Medium | Optimize the platform's architecture to reduce energy consumption. Use energy-efficient cloud services and implement power-saving features. |\n| Dependence on AI model providers | Medium | Develop a diversified AI model provider strategy to reduce dependence on a single provider. Implement a backup and disaster recovery plan to ensure continuity of service. |\n| Unfriendly interfaces | Medium | Conduct user testing and gather feedback to improve the user experience. Implement a user-centered design approach to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. |\n| Lack of feedback | Medium | Implement a feedback mechanism to collect user feedback and suggestions. Use this feedback to improve the platform and enhance the user experience. |\n| Poor prioritization of functionalities | Medium | Conduct a thorough analysis of the platform's functionalities and prioritize them based on user needs and business goals. Implement a agile development approach to ensure that the most important features are developed first. |\n| Low visibility on social media | Low | Develop a social media strategy to promote PREVENT-IA and increase its visibility. Share relevant content and engage with users to build a community around the platform. |\n| Difficulty in measuring training quality | Medium | Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework to measure the effectiveness of the training. Use metrics such as user engagement, learning outcomes, and certification rates to evaluate the quality of the training. |\n| AI use regulations | High | Monitor and comply with AI use regulations and guidelines. Develop a compliance plan to ensure that PREVENT-IA meets all relevant regulations and standards. |\n| Difficulty in measuring training quality | Medium | Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework to measure the effectiveness of the training. Use metrics such as user engagement, learning outcomes, and certification rates to evaluate the quality of the training. |\n\nNote: The classification of risks is subjective and may vary depending on the specific context and environment in which PREVENT-IA is used.",
