    "data": "Here is an example of a risk assessment and mitigation plan:\n\n**Identification of Possible Risks**\n\n1. **Data Breach**: Our company stores sensitive customer data, which could be compromised if our systems are hacked.\n2. **System Downtime**: Our website and online services may experience downtime due to technical issues or maintenance.\n3. **Cyber Attacks**: Our company may be targeted by cyber attacks, such as phishing or malware attacks.\n4. **Employee Error**: Employees may make mistakes that could compromise customer data or cause system downtime.\n5. **Natural Disasters**: Our office may be affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods.\n\n**Risk Classification and Mitigation Plan**\n\n| Risk | Classification | Description | Mitigation Plan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Data Breach | High | Compromise of sensitive customer data | Implement encryption, conduct regular security audits, and train employees on data protection policies. |\n| System Downtime | Medium | Downtime of website and online services | Implement load balancing, conduct regular maintenance, and have a disaster recovery plan in place. |\n| Cyber Attacks | High | Compromise of company systems and data | Implement firewalls, conduct regular security audits, and train employees on cybersecurity best practices. |\n| Employee Error | Medium | Mistakes made by employees that compromise customer data or cause system downtime | Implement employee training programs, conduct regular audits, and have a incident response plan in place. |\n| Natural Disasters | Low | Damage to office and disruption of business operations | Implement a business continuity plan, have a backup power source, and conduct regular emergency drills. |\n\n**Risk Classification Criteria**\n\n* **High**: Risks that have a high likelihood of occurring and could have a significant impact on the business.\n* **Medium**: Risks that have a medium likelihood of occurring and could have a moderate impact on the business.\n* **Low**: Risks that have a low likelihood of occurring and could have a minimal impact on the business.\n* **Discarded**: Risks that are unlikely to occur and do not require mitigation.\n\nNote: The risk classification and mitigation plan is just an example and may vary depending on the specific business and industry.",
