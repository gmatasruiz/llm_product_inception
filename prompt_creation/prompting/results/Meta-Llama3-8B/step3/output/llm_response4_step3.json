    "data": "Based on the provided information, I have generated multiple sets of 3 key objectives for the development of the product PREVENT-IA. Here are the sets:\n\n**Set 1**\n\n1. Develop a user-friendly and intuitive interface for workers to access and complete training modules on occupational risk prevention.\n2. Implement AI-powered content generation and evaluation to ensure the training content is up-to-date, relevant, and effective in reducing accidents.\n3. Establish a robust reporting and analytics system to track training outcomes, identify areas for improvement, and provide insights for managers and site managers.\n\n**Set 2**\n\n1. Design a scalable and secure architecture for PREVENT-IA, utilizing AWS and other cloud-based services to ensure high availability and reliability.\n2. Develop a comprehensive content management system that allows for easy creation, updating, and annotation of training content, with features such as link to certification pages and PDF editor.\n3. Implement a robust user management system that enables managers to assign training to workers, track their progress, and generate reports on training outcomes.\n\n**Set 3**\n\n1. Develop a certification program that provides workers with a recognized qualification in occupational risk prevention, with links to certification pages and evaluation of learning outcomes.\n2. Implement a personalized training program that takes into account the worker's job role, risk activities, and learning style, with features such as dynamic training and learning results dashboard.\n3. Establish a feedback mechanism that allows workers to provide feedback on the training program, with features such as chat for resolving doubts and email notifications.\n\n**Set 4**\n\n1. Develop a comprehensive training program that covers various risk activities, such as on-site training access, and is oriented to specific activities and job roles.\n2. Implement a robust content generation system that uses AI-powered tools to generate training content from updated sources, with features such as GPT and pgVector.\n3. Establish a system for tracking and measuring training quality, with features such as learning outcomes evaluation and reporting generation.\n\n**Set 5**\n\n1. Develop a secure and scalable architecture for PREVENT-IA, utilizing CI/CD and autoscaling groups to ensure high availability and reliability.\n2. Implement a comprehensive user profile management system that enables managers to assign training to workers, track their progress, and generate reports on training outcomes.\n3. Establish a system for tracking and measuring training outcomes, with features such as learning outcomes evaluation and reporting generation.\n\nThese sets of objectives are designed to address the key requirements and risks associated with the development of PREVENT-IA, including the need for a user-friendly interface, scalable architecture, comprehensive content management system, and robust reporting and analytics system.",
