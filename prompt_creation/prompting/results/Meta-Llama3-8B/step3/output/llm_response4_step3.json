    "data": "Based on the provided information, I have generated multiple sets of 3 key objectives for the development of the product PREVENT-IA. Here are the objectives:\n\n**Set 1**\n\n1. Develop a user-friendly and intuitive interface that allows workers to easily access and navigate the platform, reducing the risk of accidents and improving their understanding of occupational risk prevention.\n2. Implement a robust and scalable architecture that ensures the platform is secure, reliable, and efficient, with minimal energy consumption and low dependence on AI model providers.\n3. Create a comprehensive and up-to-date content library that includes relevant and verified sources, allowing workers to access accurate and reliable information on occupational risk prevention.\n\n**Set 2**\n\n1. Design a chat-based system that effectively resolves doubts and provides clear explanations, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and improving the overall learning experience.\n2. Develop a robust evaluation system that accurately measures learning outcomes and provides actionable feedback, enabling workers to identify areas for improvement and track their progress.\n3. Implement a reporting system that generates detailed and customizable reports, allowing managers and site managers to monitor training effectiveness and make data-driven decisions.\n\n**Set 3**\n\n1. Create a personalized training experience that takes into account the specific activities and tasks of each worker, reducing the risk of accidents and improving their understanding of occupational risk prevention.\n2. Develop a dynamic training system that adapts to the needs and preferences of each worker, providing a more engaging and effective learning experience.\n3. Implement a certification system that provides workers with a recognized and verifiable qualification, demonstrating their knowledge and competence in occupational risk prevention.\n\n**Set 4**\n\n1. Develop a comprehensive and integrated platform that includes all the necessary features and tools to support workers in their training and development, reducing the risk of accidents and improving their understanding of occupational risk prevention.\n2. Implement a scalable and secure architecture that ensures the platform is reliable and efficient, with minimal energy consumption and low dependence on AI model providers.\n3. Create a content library that includes relevant and verified sources, allowing workers to access accurate and reliable information on occupational risk prevention.\n\n**Set 5**\n\n1. Design a user-centered and intuitive interface that is easy to use and navigate, reducing the risk of accidents and improving the overall learning experience.\n2. Develop a robust and reliable architecture that ensures the platform is secure, efficient, and scalable, with minimal energy consumption and low dependence on AI model providers.\n3. Implement a comprehensive and up-to-date content library that includes relevant and verified sources, allowing workers to access accurate and reliable information on occupational risk prevention.\n\nAfter analyzing the objectives, I have selected the most consistent and relevant ones, which are:\n\n**Set 1**\n\n1. Develop a user-friendly and intuitive interface that allows workers to easily access and navigate the platform, reducing the risk of accidents and improving their understanding of occupational risk prevention.\n2. Implement a robust and scalable architecture that ensures the platform is secure, reliable, and efficient, with minimal energy consumption and low dependence on AI model providers.\n3. Create a comprehensive and up-to-date content library that includes relevant and verified sources, allowing workers to access accurate and reliable information on occupational risk prevention.\n\nThese objectives are consistent with the product's core idea and the provided information, and they address the main risks and challenges associated with the development of PREVENT-IA.",
