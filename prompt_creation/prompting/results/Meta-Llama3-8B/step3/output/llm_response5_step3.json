To achieve this, the platform should focus on developing engaging and interactive content, evaluating learning outcomes, and providing personalized training recommendations. The platform should also ensure that the training is accessible, organized, and easy to navigate, with clear and concise language.\n\n2. **Enhance the user experience and adoption**: To ensure the success of PREVENT-IA, it is crucial to design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that is accessible to the target audience. The platform should provide a seamless user experience, with features such as chat support, user profile management, and reporting generation. Additionally, the platform should be optimized for scalability and reliability, with features such as autoscaling groups and secrets management.\n\n3. **Mitigate risks and ensure compliance with regulations**: PREVENT-IA should prioritize the development of features that mitigate the identified risks, such as negative public opinion on the use of AI, energy consumption, and dependence on AI model providers. The platform should also ensure compliance with AI use regulations and provide transparency and accountability in its use of AI. Additionally, the platform should prioritize the development of features that provide feedback and evaluation mechanisms to ensure the quality of the training and the effectiveness of the platform.\n\nThese objectives should guide the development of PREVENT-IA, ensuring that the platform is effective, user-friendly, and compliant with regulations.",
