    "data": "Let's go through a step-by-step process to identify the features that fall outside the core functionalities of a product.\n\n**Step 1: Define the core functionalities**\n\nTo start, we need to identify the core functionalities of the product. These are the essential features that the product is designed to provide to its users. For example, if we're talking about a mobile app for online shopping, the core functionalities might include:\n\n* User authentication and account management\n* Product catalog and search functionality\n* Shopping cart and checkout process\n* Payment processing and order management\n\n**Step 2: Identify the features that support the core functionalities**\n\nNext, we need to identify the features that support the core functionalities. These features are essential to the functioning of the product, but they may not be the core features themselves. For example, in our online shopping app:\n\n* User registration and password recovery\n* Product categorization and filtering\n* Payment gateway integration\n* Order tracking and shipping notifications\n\n**Step 3: Identify the features that enhance the user experience**\n\nNow, let's identify the features that enhance the user experience but are not essential to the core functionalities. These features may provide additional value to the user, but they are not critical to the functioning of the product. For example:\n\n* Personalized product recommendations\n* Wish lists and saved searches\n* Product reviews and ratings\n* Social sharing and referral programs\n\n**Step 4: Identify the features that are outside the product's scope**\n\nFinally, let's identify the features that are outside the product's scope. These features may be nice-to-have or even nice-but-not-necessary, but they are not essential to the functioning of the product or the user experience. For example:\n\n* Integration with third-party services (e.g., social media, email marketing)\n* Advanced analytics and reporting\n* Customizable user interface and branding\n* Integration with other products or services (e.g., loyalty programs, customer relationship management)\n\nHere is the list of features that are outside the product's scope:\n\n* Integration with third-party services (e.g., social media, email marketing)\n* Advanced analytics and reporting\n* Customizable user interface and branding\n* Integration with other products or services (e.g., loyalty programs, customer relationship management)\n\nThese features may be nice-to-have or even nice-but-not-necessary, but they are not essential to the functioning of the product or the user experience. They may be considered as potential future developments or enhancements, but they are not within the scope of the current product development.",
