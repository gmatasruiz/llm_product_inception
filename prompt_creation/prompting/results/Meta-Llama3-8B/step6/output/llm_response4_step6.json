After reviewing them, I have selected the most consistent and comprehensive list. Here is the selected list of out-of-scope features:\n\n\u2022 **Social media integration**: PREVENT-IA does not require integration with social media platforms to function.\n\u2022 **Gamification**: The product does not include features that use game design elements to engage users, such as rewards, leaderboards, or challenges.\n\u2022 **Virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) training**: The product does not require VR or AR capabilities to deliver its training content.\n\u2022 **Mobile app**: While the product may have a mobile-friendly interface, it does not require a dedicated mobile app to function.\n\u2022 **Integration with other AI-powered platforms**: The product's architecture is based on AWS and other specific technologies, but it does not require integration with other AI-powered platforms.\n\u2022 **Real-time monitoring and alerting**: The product does not require real-time monitoring and alerting features to detect and prevent accidents.\n\u2022 **Integration with wearable devices**: The product does not require integration with wearable devices, such as smartwatches or fitness trackers, to monitor worker safety.\n\u2022 **Natural language processing (NLP) or speech recognition**: The product does not require NLP or speech recognition capabilities to analyze user input or provide voice-based training.\n\u2022 **Integration with IoT devices**: The product does not require integration with IoT devices to monitor workplace conditions or detect potential hazards.\n\u2022 **Video conferencing or live streaming**: The product does not require video conferencing or live streaming features to deliver training content.\n\nThese features are out-of-scope for PREVENT-IA because they are not necessary to achieve its core objectives of reducing workplace accidents, facilitating access to on-site ORP training, and ensuring the monitoring of ORP training.",
