    "data": "Certainly! Below are multiple tables categorizing the risks associated with PREVENT-IA. After evaluating them, I will present the most consistent and comprehensive one along with effective mitigation plans.\n\n### Table 1: Risk Classification by Source\n\n| Risk | Classification | Mitigation Plan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Negative public opinion on the use of AI | External | Conduct public awareness campaigns and transparency reports |\n| Energy consumption | Technical | Implement energy-efficient algorithms and green cloud solutions |\n| Dependence on AI model providers | Strategic | Establish multiple AI partnerships to diversify risks |\n| Unfriendly interfaces | User Experience (UX) | Continuously gather user feedback and conduct UX testing |\n| Lack of feedback | Process | Implement regular feedback mechanisms, such as surveys and reviews |\n| Poor prioritization of functionalities | Management | Adopt agile methodologies and prioritize based on user needs |\n| Low visibility on social media | Marketing | Invest in targeted social media campaigns and SEO |\n| Difficulty in measuring training quality | Technical | Develop robust evaluation metrics and use data analytics |\n| AI use regulations | Compliance | Stay up-to-date with regulations and adapt as necessary |\n\n### Table 2: Risk Classification by Impact\n\n| Risk | Impact Level | Mitigation Plan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Negative public opinion on the use of AI | High | Transparent communication and PR strategies |\n| Energy consumption | Medium | Optimize energy usage and explore renewable options |\n| Dependence on AI model providers | High | Secure alternative AI vendors and ensure model compatibility |\n| Unfriendly interfaces | High | User-centered design and iterative testing |\n| Lack of feedback | Medium | Introduce regular feedback loops and user surveys |\n| Poor prioritization of functionalities | Medium | Use agile workflows to reprioritize frequently |\n| Low visibility on social media | Low | Enhance digital marketing efforts |\n| Difficulty in measuring training quality | High | Develop standardized assessment tools and analytics dashboards |\n| AI use regulations | High | Compliance team to monitor and ensure adherence to regulations |\n\n### Table 3: Comprehensive Risk Classification with Mitigation Plans\n\n| Risk | Source | Impact Level | Mitigation Plan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Negative public opinion on the use of AI | External | High | Conduct public awareness campaigns, publish transparency reports, and engage in PR activities |\n| Energy consumption | Technical | Medium | Implement energy-efficient algorithms, utilize green cloud solutions, and monitor usage |\n| Dependence on AI model providers | Strategic | High | Establish multiple AI partnerships, diversify AI sources, and ensure model adaptability |\n| Unfriendly interfaces | User Experience (UX) | High | Conduct UX testing, gather continuous user feedback, and employ user-centered design |\n| Lack of feedback | Process | Medium | Implement regular feedback mechanisms such as surveys and periodic reviews |\n| Poor prioritization of functionalities | Management | Medium | Adopt agile methodologies and prioritize based on iterative user feedback and market needs |\n| Low visibility on social media | Marketing | Low | Invest in targeted social media campaigns, SEO, and enhance digital presence |\n| Difficulty in measuring training quality | Technical | High | Develop robust evaluation metrics, use data analytics, and create standardized assessment tools |\n| AI use regulations | Compliance | High | Monitor regulatory landscape, adapt processes to meet compliance requirements, and engage legal experts |\n\nAfter reviewing all the tables, Table 3 appears to be the most consistent and comprehensive, integrating both sources and impact levels along with effective mitigation plans. Below is Table 3 in markdown format:\n\n```markdown\n| Risk | Source | Impact Level | Mitigation Plan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Negative public opinion on the use of AI | External | High | Conduct public awareness campaigns, publish transparency reports, and engage in PR activities |\n| Energy consumption | Technical | Medium | Implement energy-efficient algorithms, utilize green cloud solutions, and monitor usage |\n| Dependence on AI model providers | Strategic | High | Establish multiple AI partnerships, diversify AI sources, and ensure model adaptability |\n| Unfriendly interfaces | User Experience (UX) | High | Conduct UX testing, gather continuous user feedback, and employ user-centered design |\n| Lack of feedback | Process | Medium | Implement regular feedback mechanisms such as surveys and periodic reviews |\n| Poor prioritization of functionalities | Management | Medium | Adopt agile methodologies and prioritize based on iterative user feedback and market needs |\n| Low visibility on social media | Marketing | Low | Invest in targeted social media campaigns, SEO, and enhance digital presence |\n| Difficulty in measuring training quality | Technical | High | Develop robust evaluation metrics, use data analytics, and create standardized assessment tools |\n| AI use regulations | Compliance | High | Monitor regulatory landscape, adapt processes to meet compliance requirements, and engage legal experts |\n```",
