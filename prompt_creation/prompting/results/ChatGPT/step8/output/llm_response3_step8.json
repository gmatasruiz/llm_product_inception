    "data": "### Product Architecture Proposal for PREVENT-IA\n\nThe architecture for PREVENT-IA must be designed to accommodate the various functionalities and ensure scalability, security, and efficiency. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the proposed architecture and some use scenarios:\n\n#### Core Architecture Components:\n1. **Frontend (UI/UX):**\n   - **Technologies:** React, Figma\n   - **Purpose:** Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the platform.\n\n2. **Backend:**\n   - **Technologies:** Python, REST API, GPT\n   - **Purpose:** Manages business logic, communications with AI models, and interface with the database.\n\n3. **Database:**\n   - **Technologies:** pgVector\n   - **Purpose:** Efficiently store structured data related to users, training content, and training outcomes.\n\n4. **Cloud Infrastructure:**\n   - **Technologies:** AWS, Cloud Computing, Autoscaling Groups, Secrets Management\n   - **Purpose:** Ensure the platform is scalable, secure, and performs reliably under varying loads.\n\n5. **DevOps:**\n   - **Technologies:** CI/CD, Code Builder, Github\n   - **Purpose:** Automate deployment processes and maintain code quality.\n\n6. **Additional Services:**\n   - **Technologies:** Jira (project management), Email (notifications), PDF Editor (document management)\n   - **Purpose:** Facilitate team collaboration, user communication, and document handling.\n\n#### Use Scenarios:\n\n1. **User Registration and Profile Management:**\n   - **Step 1:** A worker registers on the platform and creates a profile. The frontend sends user data to the backend via REST API.\n   - **Step 2:** The backend processes the data and stores it in the database.\n   - **Step 3:** The user receives a confirmation email.\n\n2. **Assigning Training to Workers:**\n   - **Step 1:** A manager logs into the platform and assigns specific ORP training modules to workers.\n   - **Step 2:** The backend receives this request and updates training assignments in the database.\n   - **Step 3:** Workers receive email notifications about their new training assignments.\n\n3. **Interactive Learning:**\n   - **Step 1:** Workers log in to start their assigned training module.\n   - **Step 2:** The frontend pulls the relevant training content via REST API from the backend.\n   - **Step 3:** The backend generates personalized content using GPT and supplements it with verified sources.\n   - **Step 4:** The worker interacts with the platform, asks questions via chat, and the AI provides answers or additional resources.\n\n4. **Training Outcome Evaluation:**\n   - **Step 1:** After completing a training module, workers undergo an evaluation.\n   - **Step 2:** Their responses are sent to the backend, which processes and stores the results in the database.\n   - **Step 3:** The platform generates a report summarizing the evaluation and learning outcomes, accessible to both workers and managers.\n\n5. **Report Generation and Content Annotation:**\n   - **Step 1:** Trainers and managers can request reports on training participation and outcomes.\n   - **Step 2:** The backend aggregates relevant data from the database.\n   - **Step 3:** The PDF Editor formats the report, and it's delivered via email or directly accessible on the web platform.\n\n6. **On-site Training Access:**\n   - **Step 1:** Workers require access to on-site ORP training modules.\n   - **Step 2:** They log into the platform remotely and access the relevant modules, which are available offline if necessary.\n   - **Step 3:** Upon completion, data syncs back to the primary database when the connection is restored.\n\n#### Mitigation of Risks:\n- **Negative Public Opinion on AI:**\n  - Educational campaigns and transparent communication about AI's role and benefits.\n- **Energy Consumption:**\n  - Use of energy-efficient cloud computing solutions and optimizing resource allocation.\n- **Dependence on AI Model Providers:**\n  - Maintain contracts with multiple providers and explore in-house AI model development.\n- **Unfriendly Interfaces:**\n  - Continuous UI/UX testing and feedback loops with real users.\n- **Lack of Feedback:**\n  - Implement regular surveys and feedback tools within the platform.\n- **Poor Functionality Prioritization:**\n  - Use Jira for effective project and backlog management.\n- **Low Social Media Visibility:**\n  - Collaborate with the marketing department for better outreach strategies.\n- **Difficulty Measuring Training Quality:**\n  - Regularly update evaluation methods and analyze learning outcomes using data analytics.\n- **AI Use Regulations:**\n  - Stay updated with regulations and maintain legal consultations.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe architecture for PREVENT-IA aims to balance functionality, scalability, and user experience while mitigating identified risks. By focusing on a robust core infrastructure and intuitive frontend, the platform can effectively meet its objectives of reducing workplace accidents and facilitating comprehensive ORP training. Use scenarios demonstrate the practical flow of operations, emphasizing seamless integration of AI-powered features and user-centric design.",
