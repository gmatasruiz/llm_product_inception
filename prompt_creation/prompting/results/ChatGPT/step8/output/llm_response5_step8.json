    "data": "### Proposed Technical Architecture for PREVENT-IA\n\n#### 1. Overall System Architecture\n\n**Frontend:**\n- **Web Platform:** \n    - **React:** For building a responsive and interactive user interface along with Figma for designing the UI/UX.\n    - **Figma:** Tool for designing the user interface and user experience.\n- **APIs and Integration:**\n    - **REST API:** To facilitate communication between frontend and backend services.\n    - **PDF Editor:** For generating certification documents and training materials.\n\n**Backend:**\n- **Core Computing Services:**\n    - **AWS:** For reliable cloud infrastructure with autoscaling capabilities.\n    - **Cloud Computing:** For scalability and to handle large compute workloads efficiently.\n    - **CI/CD:** Code Builder and Autoscaling Groups for continuous integration and continuous deployment.\n    - **pgVector:** For managing vectorized data efficiently.\n    - **Secrets Management:** For securely managing sensitive data like API keys and credentials.\n    - **Python:** Backend logic and services coded in Python for performance and flexibility.\n    - **GPT (Natural Language Processing):** For generating and annotating content, evaluating learning outcomes, and chat functionalities.\n\n**DevOps:**\n- **Jira:** For project management and issue tracking.\n- **Github:** Source code repository and version control.\n- **Email Integration:** Automatic email notifications and reports to users.\n\n**Security:**\n- **Secrets Management:** Ensuring secure storage and access to sensitive information.\n- **REST API:** Secure APIs for communication between different services.\n\n### Use Scenarios\n\n1. **Scenario 1: Interactive Training Session**\n   - **User:** Site Manager\n   - **Action:** Site Manager assigns tailored ORP training sessions to workers.\n   - **Flow:**\n       1. The site manager logs into the PREVENT-IA platform.\n       2. They navigate to the training assignment section.\n       3. Using the user profile management feature, they assign specific training modules based on the worker's risk profile and tasks.\n       4. Workers receive an email notification about the newly assigned training.\n       5. Workers complete the interactive training sessions, which include AI-generated content, quizzes, and additional information sourced from verified sources.\n       6. The system evaluates their learning outcomes and generates a detailed report for review by the site manager.\n   - **Outcome:** Tailored training content ensures workers are well-prepared for specific risks, reducing workplace accidents.\n\n2. **Scenario 2: Real-time Query Resolution**\n   - **User:** Worker\n   - **Action:** Worker uses the chat feature to resolve doubts during training.\n   - **Flow:**\n       1. Worker logs into the PREVENT-IA platform during a training session.\n       2. They encounter a doubt or question and open the chat feature.\n       3. The AI-powered chat analyzes the query, using GPT to provide accurate, contextually relevant information sourced from the latest guidelines.\n       4. If needed, the chat offers links to certification pages or additional reading materials.\n   - **Outcome:** Immediate resolution of doubts enhances learning efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n3. **Scenario 3: Training Monitoring and Feedback**\n   - **User:** HR Department\n   - **Action:** HR department monitors ongoing training sessions and gathers feedback.\n   - **Flow:**\n       1. HR department accesses the learning results dashboard through the PREVENT-IA web platform.\n       2. They review the assigned training sessions, completion rates, and performance metrics.\n       3. HR gathers feedback from workers using integrated survey tools embedded within the platform.\n       4. Using the collected data, HR identifies areas for improving training material or processes.\n   - **Outcome:** Continuous monitoring and feedback loop ensures the training remains relevant and effective, driving higher completion rates and better learning outcomes.\n\n4. **Scenario 4: Generating Compliance Reports**\n   - **User:** Quality Department\n   - **Action:** Quality department generates compliance reports for internal audits.\n   - **Flow:**\n       1. Quality officer logs into the PREVENT-IA platform.\n       2. They navigate to the report generation section.\n       3. Using predefined templates and real-time data, they generate detailed compliance reports highlighting training completion rates, learning outcomes, and worker certifications.\n       4. Reports can be exported as PDF documents for internal audits or presentations.\n   - **Outcome:** Automated compliance reporting saves time and ensures accurate, up-to-date records for audits.\n\n### Strengths\n- **Scalability:** Leveraging AWS and autoscaling groups ensures the system can handle varying loads seamlessly.\n- **Security:** Secure management of sensitive data and REST APIs for encrypted communication.\n- **Interactivity:** AI-powered chat and dynamic content creation offer a superior learning experience.\n- **Integration:** Seamless integration with corporate tools like Jira and GitHub enhances operational efficiency.\n\n### Weaknesses\n- **Energy Consumption:** Heavy reliance on cloud computing and AI models may result in significant energy consumption.\n- **Dependence:** Dependence on third-party AI model providers can lead to potential issues with service interruptions or cost escalations.\n- **User Experience:** The complexity of managing advanced features might result in a steep learning curve for non-tech-savvy users.\n- **Regulations:** Potential complications arising from evolving regulations regarding AI use in occupational training.\n\nIn summary, the proposed technical architecture for PREVENT-IA leverages advanced AI and cloud technologies to offer an interactive, scalable, and efficient platform for Occupational Risk Prevention training. The use scenarios illustrate how different users can benefit from its features, ensuring workplace safety and compliance.",
