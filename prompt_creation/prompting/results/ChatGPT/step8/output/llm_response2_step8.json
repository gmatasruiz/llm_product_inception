Infrastructure Components:**\n- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n  - **Services Used:**\n    - **Elastic Beanstalk:** For deploying and scaling web applications.\n    - **RDS (Relational Database Service):** For PostgreSQL database.\n    - **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** For storing training resources and reports.\n    - **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** For scalable computing capacity.\n    - **Autoscaling Groups:** For dynamically adjusting the number of EC2 instances.\n    - **CodeBuild and CodePipeline:** For CI/CD.\n    - **Secrets Manager:** For managing sensitive information.\n- **APIs:** REST API for communication between microservices and frontend.\n- **Frontend:**\n  - **Tech Stack:** React, Figma (for UI/UX design).\n  - **Functionality:** User interaction, training dashboards, content browsing.\n- **Security:**\n  - **Secure API Gateway:** For secure integration with different services.\n  - **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** For access control and security management.\n\n### Use Scenarios\n\n#### **1. Scenario: Training Assignment**\n- **Stakeholder:** Managers\n- **Uses:** \n  - Managers log into PREVENT-IA.\n  - They navigate to the Training Module and assign specific ORP training to new workers.\n- **Risks:**\n  - Unauthorized access if proper IAM policies are not enforced.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.\n\n#### **2. Scenario: Real-time Query Resolution**\n- **Stakeholder:** Workers\n- **Uses:** \n  - A worker is going through a training module and has a specific question.\n  - The worker uses the chat feature to ask the question.\n  - The AI-powered chat responds in real-time with the required information.\n- **Risks:**\n  - AI model providing inaccurate or outdated information.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - Regularly update the GPT model with current and verified data sources.\n\n#### **3. Scenario: Training Outcome Evaluation**\n- **Stakeholder:** Site Managers\n- **Uses:** \n  - Site Managers want to evaluate the training outcomes of their team.\n  - They access the Report Generation service to generate detailed reports.\n  - Insights are used to identify areas requiring further training.\n- **Risks:**\n  - Data breach exposing sensitive training data.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - Implement secure API Gateway and data encryption.\n\n#### **4. Scenario: Feedback Collection**\n- **Stakeholder:** HR Department, Quality Department\n- **Uses:** \n  - Departments want to collect feedback regarding the training modules.\n  - They use the Feedback Analysis service to collect and analyze feedback.\n  - Feedback insights are used to improve the training contents and platform functionality.\n- **Risks:**\n  - Poor interpretation of feedback impacting training quality.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - Ensure robust feedback analysis mechanisms and incorporate feedback loops.\n\n#### **5. Scenario: Periodic Content Update**\n- **Stakeholder:** Core Team (Developers)\n- **Uses:** \n  - Developers periodically update the training content by leveraging the Content Management Service.\n  - Verify that content is accurate and aligned with latest regulations.\n- **Risks:**\n  - Downtime during content update affecting user access.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - Implement CI/CD pipelines for seamless updates with minimal downtime.\n\nThis architecture and use scenario plan ensure that PREVENT-IA is scalable, secure, and meets the stakeholders' needs efficiently. It also mitigates potential risks through concrete technical solutions.",
