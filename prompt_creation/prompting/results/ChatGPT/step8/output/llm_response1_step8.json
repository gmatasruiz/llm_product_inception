    "data": "Certainly! Below is a proposed technical architecture for the PREVENT-IA product, along with some use scenarios covering stakeholders, common uses, and associated risks.\n\n### Technical Architecture Proposal\n\n#### 1. Architecture Overview:\n- **Frontend:**\n  - **React**: For building the user interface.\n  - **Figma**: For designing the UI/UX.\n  - **REST API**: Communication between frontend and backend services.\n\n- **Backend:**\n  - **Python**: Primary programming language for backend services.\n  - **AWS**: For cloud infrastructure, including services like S3 for storage, EC2 for compute instances, and RDS for databases.\n  - **pgVector**: For handling vector data particularly useful for AI models.\n  - **Cloud Computing**: General infrastructure for scalable computing.\n  - **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment for automated testing and deployment.\n  - **Autoscaling Groups**: To handle varying loads.\n  - **Secrets Management**: For securely managing sensitive information.\n  - **Code Builder**: For building and deploying code automatically.\n\n- **Tools:**\n  - **Jira**: For project and issue tracking.\n  - **GitHub**: For version control.\n  - **PDF Editor**: For generating and managing reports.\n  - **Email**: For communication services within the platform.\n\n- **AI Integration:**\n  - **GPT**: For content generation and chatbot functionalities.\n\n#### 2. Detailed Component Diagram:\n\nSince the model doesn't have image support, here's a textual representation:\n\n1. **Frontend Layer:**\n   - **React (User Interface)** \n     - Connects with REST API to fetch/send data.\n     - Integrates with Figma for UI/UX.\n   - **User Authentication:**\n     - Manages user profiles.\n\n2. **Backend Layer:**\n   - **API Gateway:**\n     - REST API for communication between frontend and backend.\n   - **Microservices:**\n     - **Training Service**: Manage and track training modules.\n     - **Content Generation Service**: Uses GPT to create and update content.\n     - **User Management Service**: For handling user profiles and roles.\n     - **Reporting Service**: Generates reports and usage analytics.\n   - **Data Storage**:\n     - **RDS/pgVector**: Stores structured data including training records, user data, etc.\n   - **Caching and Load Balancing**:\n     - **Autoscaling Groups**: For distributing loads.\n     - **Load Balancers**: Ensures efficient traffic distribution.\n   - **Cloud Services**:\n     - **AWS S3**: For storing large files and documents.\n     - **CI/CD Pipelines**: For automating build and deployment processes.\n\n4. **Tools & Integrations:**\n   - **Project Management**: Integration with Jira for project tracking.\n   - **Version Control**: GitHub for tracking code changes.\n   - **Email**: For notifications and communication.\n\n### Use Scenarios\n\n#### 1. Scenario: Training Evaluation and Certification\n- **Stakeholder**: Trainers, Workers, HR Department\n- **Common Uses**:\n  - Trainers can assign training modules to workers.\n  - Workers complete training modules and get evaluated on their learning outcomes.\n  - HR Department tracks the progress and generates reports.\n- **Risks**:\n  - Negative public perception of AI used for training.\n  - Lack of feedback from the workers leading to incomplete training cycles.\n\n#### 2. Scenario: Dynamic Content Generation\n- **Stakeholder**: Core Team, Quality Department\n- **Common Uses**:\n  - AI generates new training content using GPT.\n  - QA Team reviews and validates the content before it's published.\n- **Risks**:\n  - AI-produced content may have inaccuracies.\n  - Dependence on third-party AI providers.\n\n#### 3. Scenario: User Profile and Training Management\n- **Stakeholder**: Site Managers, Workers\n- **Common Uses**:\n  - Site Managers can create profiles for new workers and assign necessary training.\n  - Workers update their profiles and track their training progress.\n- **Risks**:\n  - Security vulnerabilities in managing user profiles.\n  - Unfriendly interfaces lead to low user engagement.\n\n#### 4. Scenario: Report Generation and Distribution\n- **Stakeholder**: Managers, Finance Department\n- **Common Uses**:\n  - Generate reports on training effectiveness and worker performance.\n  - Distribute periodic reports to the management for review.\n- **Risks**:\n  - High energy consumption during report generation.\n  - Poor prioritization of functionalities affecting report accuracy.\n\n#### 5. Scenario: On-site Training Access\n- **Stakeholder**: Transporters, Logistics\n- **Common Uses**:\n  - Workers receive on-site training guidance through the platform.\n  - Logistics teams coordinate the availability of necessary training materials.\n- **Risks**:\n  - Poor network connectivity affecting training access.\n  - Regulatory issues regarding the use of AI in safety-critical training.\n\nBy addressing these use scenarios and the associated risks, the proposed technical architecture aims to effectively serve various stakeholders while mitigating potential risks.",
