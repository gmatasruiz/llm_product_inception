Onboarding:\n* A new worker is added to the system\n* The system assigns the worker a training plan based on their role and activity\n* The worker completes the training using the interactive platform\n* The system tracks the worker's progress and generates reports\n\n2. Certification:\n* A worker wants to obtain a certification\n* The system provides access to external certification pages\n* The worker completes the certification process outside the system\n* The system updates the worker's profile with the new certification\n\n3. Content Management:\n* A trainer updates the training content\n* The system automatically generates new content from updated sources\n* The system annotates the content with additional information\n* The system complements the content with verified sources\n* The system organizes the information by topics and chapters\n* The system includes corporate content in the training plan\n\n4. Monitoring and Reporting:\n* The system monitors the training progress of all workers\n* The system generates reports on the training outcomes\n* The system evaluates the learning outcomes of each worker\n* The system provides feedback to workers and trainers\n\n5. Scalability and Performance:\n* The system automatically scales up or down based on demand\n* The system ensures high availability and performance\n* The system uses AI and machine learning to optimize performance\n\nRecommended Architecture:\n\nBased on the requirements and objectives, the Serverless Architecture is the most consistent and robust option. It provides high scalability, availability, and performance, while minimizing operational overhead and costs. The use scenarios are well supported by the serverless components, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience.",
