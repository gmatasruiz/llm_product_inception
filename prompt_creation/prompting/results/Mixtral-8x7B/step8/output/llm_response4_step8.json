    "data": "Technical Architecture Option 1:\n\n* Application and API Server: Hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, powered by Python and REST API for communication with the frontend.\n* Database: PostgreSQL with pgVector extension for vector-based search, managed by AWS RDS.\n* Frontend: Hosted on AWS Amplify, built with React and UI/UX designed in Figma.\n* Authentication and Authorization: AWS Cognito for user management and authentication.\n* Machine Learning: GPT-3 for content generation and evaluation, managed by AWS SageMaker.\n* Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment: GitHub Actions for CI/CD.\n* Backend Infrastructure: Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.\n* Containerization: Docker for containerizing the application and services.\n* Orchestration: AWS ECS for container orchestration.\n* Monitoring and Logging: AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n1. A site manager assigns training to a worker. The worker receives an email notification with a link to the training. The worker logs in to PREVENT-IA, completes the training, and their progress is tracked.\n2. A trainer creates new content and uploads it to the platform. The content is then annotated, complemented with verified sources, and organized by topics/chapters.\n3. A worker has a doubt while completing the training. They use the chat feature to ask their question and receive a response from the trainer.\n4. The system evaluates the worker's learning outcomes and generates a report. The report is then used to measure the training quality and provide feedback to the worker.\n\nTechnical Architecture Option 2:\n\n* Application and API Server: Hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), powered by Python and REST API for communication with the frontend.\n* Database: Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, managed by GCP.\n* Frontend: Hosted on Firebase, built with React and UI/UX designed in Figma.\n* Authentication and Authorization: Firebase Authentication for user management and authentication.\n* Machine Learning: AutoML for content generation and evaluation, managed by GCP.\n* Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment: GitHub Actions for CI/CD.\n* Backend Infrastructure: Serverless architecture using Google Cloud Functions, Cloud Scheduler, and Cloud Firestore.\n* Containerization: Google Container Registry for containerizing the application and services.\n* Orchestration: Google Kubernetes Engine for container orchestration.\n* Monitoring and Logging: Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging for monitoring and logging.\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n1. A manager assigns training to a worker. The worker receives an email notification with a link to the training. The worker logs in to PREVENT-IA, completes the training, and their progress is tracked.\n2. A trainer creates new content and uploads it to the platform. The content is then annotated, complemented with verified sources, and organized by topics/chapters.\n3. A worker has a doubt while completing the training. They use the chat feature to ask their question and receive a response from the trainer.\n4. The system evaluates the worker's learning outcomes and generates a report. The report is then used to measure the training quality and provide feedback to the worker.\n\nReview:\n\nBoth architectures provide a robust solution for PREVENT-IA, but Option 1 is more consistent with the given requirements. Option 1 includes more features that align with the product traits, such as scalability, autoscaling groups, and secrets management. Additionally, Option 1 includes a more comprehensive use scenario list, which covers all the key objectives of PREVENT-IA.\n\nHowever, Option 2 is also a viable solution, and it can be considered if there are specific requirements or preferences for GCP. Option 2 also provides a robust solution, but it lacks some features like secrets management and autoscaling groups. Nonetheless, Option 2 can be customized to include these features if necessary.",
