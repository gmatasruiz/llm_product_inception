    "data": "Technical Architecture for PREVENT-IA:\n\n1. Frontend: The frontend of PREVENT-IA will be built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The UI/UX design will be created using Figma and then implemented in React. The frontend will communicate with the backend using REST APIs.\n2. Backend: The backend will be built using Python and will use a REST API for communication with the frontend. It will use a PostgreSQL database with pgVector for vector search and scalability. The backend will handle user authentication, content management, chat functionality, report generation, and training assignment.\n3. Infrastructure: The infrastructure will be hosted on AWS and use Cloud Computing for scalability. It will use CI/CD for automated deployment and Secrets Management for secure storage of sensitive information. Autoscaling Groups will be used to handle changes in traffic. Code Builder will be used for building and testing code.\n4. Integration: PREVENT-IA will integrate with various third-party tools such as Jira for issue tracking, Github for version control, Email for communication, and PDF Editor for document editing.\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n1. Stakeholder: Workers\nCommon Uses:\n* Accessing on-site ORP training\n* Completing training assignments\n* Using chat to resolve doubts\n* Generating reports on learning outcomes\n* Managing user profiles\n\nRisks:\n\n* Unfriendly interfaces\n* Lack of feedback\n* Poor prioritization of functionalities\n2. Stakeholder: Site Managers\nCommon Uses:\n* Assigning training to workers\n* Monitoring training progress\n* Ensuring compliance with ORP regulations\n\nRisks:\n\n* Difficulty in measuring training quality\n* AI use regulations\n3. Stakeholder: Trainers\nCommon Uses:\n* Generating content from updated sources\n* Complementing content with verified sources\n* Organizing information by topics/chapters\n* Including corporate content\n* Ensuring the monitoring of ORP training\n\nRisks:\n\n* Negative public opinion on the use of AI\n* Energy consumption\n* Dependence on AI model providers\n* Difficulty in measuring training quality\n* AI use regulations\n4. Stakeholder: Financial Sponsor\nCommon Uses:\n* Tracking training progress\n* Reducing accidents\n* Ensuring compliance with ORP regulations\n\nRisks:\n\n* Negative public opinion on the use of AI\n* Energy consumption\n* Dependence on AI model providers\n* Difficulty in measuring training quality\n* AI use regulations\n\nDiagram of the Architecture:\n\n![PREVENT-IA Architecture Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/QrJGgTb.png)",
