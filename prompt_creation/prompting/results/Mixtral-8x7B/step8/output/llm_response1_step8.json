    "data": "Technical Architecture for PREVENT-IA:\n\n1. Frontend: The frontend of PREVENT-IA will be built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The UI/UX design will be created using Figma and then implemented in React. The frontend will communicate with the backend using REST APIs.\n2. Backend: The backend will be built using Python and will use a REST API for communication with the frontend. It will use a PostgreSQL database with pgVector for vector search and scalability. The backend will handle user authentication, content management, training assignments, and reporting.\n3. Infrastructure: The infrastructure will be hosted on AWS and use Cloud Computing for scalability. It will use CI/CD for automated deployment and Secrets Management for secure storage of sensitive information. Autoscaling Groups will be used to handle changes in traffic.\n4. Integration: PREVENT-IA will integrate with various third-party tools such as Jira for issue tracking, Github for version control, Email for communication, and PDF Editor for document editing.\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n1.
