    "data": "Based on the given information, a technical architecture for PREVENT-IA can be proposed as follows:\n\n1. **Frontend**: A web platform built using React and UI/UX design tools like Figma. This will provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for workers and managers to access the platform.\n2. **Backend**: A REST API built using Python, which will handle the business logic and communication between the frontend and the database.\n3. **Database**: A PostgreSQL database with pgVector extension for vector-based search and analysis. This will store user information, training content, and learning outcomes.\n4. **Cloud Computing**: AWS will be used for hosting the platform, providing scalability and reliability.\n5. **Version Control and Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Github will be used for version control, and Code Builder will be used for continuous integration and deployment.\n6. **Security**: Secrets Management will be used to store and manage sensitive information like API keys and credentials.\n7. **Automation**: Autoscaling Groups will be used to automatically scale the infrastructure based on demand, ensuring high availability and performance.\n8. **Artificial Intelligence**: GPT will be used to generate content from updated sources, evaluate learning outcomes, and complement content with verified sources.\n9. **Integration**: Jira will be used for issue tracking and project management, and Email will be used for communication with users.\n10. **Analytics**: The platform will include a dashboard for monitoring and analyzing learning outcomes, training quality, and user feedback.\n\nUse scenarios:\n\n1. A site manager assigns training to a worker based on their job role and risk level. The worker receives a notification and completes the training using the web platform.\n2. A worker has a doubt while completing the training. They use the chat feature to ask a question and receive a response from a trainer.\n3. A manager wants to track the training progress of their team. They access the dashboard and view the learning outcomes and completion status of each worker.\n4. A trainer wants to update the training content. They use the content management system to add new information and link to certification pages.\n5. A worker wants to access the training on their mobile device. They use the web platform, which is optimized for mobile devices.\n6. The platform experiences a spike in traffic due to high demand. Autoscaling Groups automatically scale the infrastructure to handle the increased load.\n7. A worker provides feedback on the platform. The feedback is analyzed and used to improve the user experience and prioritize new features.\n8. A manager wants to generate reports on training completion and learning outcomes. They use the report generation feature to create custom reports.\n9. A worker wants to learn about a specific topic. They use the search feature to find relevant content and annotate it for future reference.\n10. A manager wants to ensure compliance with ORP regulations. They use the platform to assign training and monitor learning outcomes.",
