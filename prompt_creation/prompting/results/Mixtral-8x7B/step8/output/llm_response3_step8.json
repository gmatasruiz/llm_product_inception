REST API: The interface between the web platform and other components, enabling seamless communication and data exchange.\n3. AWS: The cloud computing infrastructure that supports the platform's scalability, reliability, and performance.\n4. PDF Editor: A tool for generating, editing, and managing PDF-based content, ensuring up-to-date and customizable materials.\n5. Jira: A project management tool for tracking issues, tasks, and progress related to the development and maintenance of PREVENT-IA.\n6. GitHub: A version control and collaboration platform for managing the source code and facilitating contributions from the development team.\n7. Email: A communication channel for users to receive notifications, updates, and support.\n8. CI/CD: A continuous integration and delivery pipeline to automate the testing, building, and deployment of new features and updates.\n9. Autoscaling Groups: A feature of AWS that automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.\n10. Code Builder: An AWS service for building, testing, and deploying code in a cloud-based environment.\n11. Secrets Management: An AWS service for securely storing, accessing, and managing sensitive information, such as API keys and passwords.\n12. Python: The primary programming language used for backend development, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.\n13. UI/UX: The design principles and practices applied to the web platform, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience.\n14. Figma: A design tool for creating, prototyping, and collaborating on user interface designs.\n15.

GPT: The AI model used for generating and evaluating learning content, ensuring an interactive and personalized learning experience.\n\nUse Scenarios:\n\n1. A site manager logs into the web platform and assigns specific training modules to their workers based on their roles and activities.\n2. A worker receives a notification via email about the assigned training and accesses the platform to complete the modules.\n3. The worker uses the chat feature to ask questions and receive real-time support during their training.\n4. The system evaluates the worker's learning outcomes and generates a report, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.\n5. The worker's progress is tracked and displayed on a dashboard, allowing managers to monitor their team's training status.\n6. The system automatically scales up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.\n7. The development team uses GitHub for version control and collaboration, addressing issues and implementing new features via the CI/CD pipeline.\n8. The legal, quality, and finance departments provide occasional input and feedback on the platform's content and features through Jira.\n9. The marketing and communication departments collaborate on promoting PREVENT-IA through social media and other channels.\n10. Insurance companies use the platform to ensure their clients' workers are adequately trained in Occupational Risk Prevention, reducing accidents and liability.",
