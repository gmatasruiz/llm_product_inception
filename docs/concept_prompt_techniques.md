- Complex implementation
- Requires ongoing adjustments

**References**: <https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques>

## Directional Stimulus Prompting

**Definition**: Directional Stimulus Prompting provides stimuli or direction to guide the model.

**How It Works**: Guides the model towards generating more relevant and accurate responses.

**Pros**:

- Improves relevance
- Provides clear guidance

**Cons**:

- May limit creativity
- Requires careful design

**References**: <https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques>
